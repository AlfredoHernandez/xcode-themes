## Installation

Each method requires you to **close any running instance of Xcode** as Xcode loads all installed custom themes when it starts.

### Using the `install.sh` script

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the root of the repository. 
3. Run the `install.sh` script.

```bash
./install.sh
```

### Manual Installation

1. Clone or download the repository in a ZIP file and unzip it. 
2. Open the Finder and select `Go -> Go to Folder...` on the menu bar (shortcut `⇧⌘G`).
3. Type `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/` and select `Go`.
4. Create a new folder called `FontAndColorThemes` if it doesn't exist inside the `UserData` folder.
5. Drag and drop `Alfred Light.xccolortheme` and `Alfred Dark.xccolortheme` inside the `FontAndColorThemes` folder.
6. Open Xcode, then select `Xcode -> Preferences` in the menu bar or use the `⌘,` keyboard shortcut.
7. Select the *Themes* tab. You'll be able to select any version of *Alfred Theme* from the list of installed themes.
